Blasteroids
===========

An HTML5 Asteroids game!

Rotate the ship with the left and right arrow keys. Fire with spacebar.

At the end of the game, upload your score to a Parse.js database and compete for the top spot!

Made with underscore.js, jQuery and Parse.

COMING SOON:
  - AABB collision detection
  - Smart placement of objects to avoid overlap
  - Wrap bounce; asteroids should bounce off each other from opposite ends of the window.
